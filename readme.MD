# Common Javascript Algorithms

## 1. Reverse a String

## 2. Check Palindrome

## 3. Find the maximum character in a string and how many times it appear
   ####  ALGORITHM:
   1. generate key-value pair
      1. create an object
      2. if the character of str does not exist in obj, then set its value to 1
      3. if it does, do an increment
   2. loop through the values of  the  object to see which one has the highest value

## 4. Reverse an integer
   ####  ALGORITHM:
   1. Convert integer to string first
   2. Turn into an array
   3. Reverse the array using reverse() method
   4. Convert back to string
   5. Finally back to int

## 5. Classic fizzbuzz problem
   ####  ALGORITHM:
   1.
