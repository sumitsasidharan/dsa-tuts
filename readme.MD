# Common Javascript Algorithms

## 1. Reverse a String

## 2. Check Palindrome

## 3. Find the maximum character in a string and how many times it appear
   ###  ALGORITHM:
   1. generate key-value pair
      i. create an object
      ii. if the character of str does not exist in obj, then set its value to 1
      iii. if it does, do an increment
   2. loop through the values of  the  object to see which one has the highest value

## 4. Reverse an integer
   Algorithm:
      a) Convert to string first
      b) turn into an array
      c) reverse method - js
      d) back to string
      e) back to int

## 5. Classic fizzbuzz problem
   Algorithm:
      a)
